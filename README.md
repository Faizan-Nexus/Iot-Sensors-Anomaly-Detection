# Iot-Sensors-Anomaly-Detection
This system uses Isolation Forest (Python) to compute an anomaly threshold from sensor data. The threshold is hardcoded into a Verilog FSM, which compares real-time sensor values and flags anomalies if values exceed the threshold. Simple, efficient, and ideal for embedded hardware.
